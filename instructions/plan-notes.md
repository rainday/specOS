## 3. Project Status

### Project Status

```
[Answer: "yes" or "no"]
Are you currently inside your project folder and ready to start planning?

Default: no (if you're not sure, answer "no")
```

**What this means:**

- **"yes"** = You have created a project folder and are currently in it, ready to start planning
- **"no"** = You haven't created a project folder yet, or you're not in the right location

**Why this matters:**
The planning process will create files and folders in your current directory. You need to be in the right project folder first.

**What to do:**

- If "no": Create a new folder for your project, navigate to it, then run the planning process
- If "yes": You're ready to proceed with planning

**Example:**

```
Want to build a task app
→ Create folder: "my-task-app"
→ Open terminal in "my-task-app"
→ Run plan-product command
→ Answer "yes" here
```

## 4. Sample Code (Optional)

```
[Describe any key components or features you want to see implemented]
Example: User authentication, dashboard layout, data tables, forms

Default Examples:
- User login/registration forms
- Dashboard with navigation sidebar
- Data table with sorting and filtering
- Modal dialogs for creating/editing items
- Responsive mobile navigation
```

### API Endpoints

- tasks (id, title, description, project_id, assigned_to, status, created_at)
- comments (id, content, task_id, user_id, created_at)
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Fill out the sections above** with your specific product information
2. **Copy and paste any text** - no special formatting needed
3. **Use the default tech stack** if you're not sure about technical choices
4. **Leave sections empty** if you don't have the information
5. **Add sample code** in the Sample Code section to help guide development
6. **Save the file** when you're done filling it out

## Quick Start for Non-Technical Users

If you're not technical, here's what to focus on:

1. **Main Idea**: Describe what your product does in simple terms
2. **Key Features**: List 3-5 main things your product should do
3. **Target Users**: Who will use your product?
4. **Project Status**: Are you ready to start? (usually "no" if you're just planning)
5. **Sample Code**: Skip this section if you don't have code examples

The technical stack will use sensible defaults that work well together.
